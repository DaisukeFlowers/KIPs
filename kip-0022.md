# Motivation

The ability for an account holder to rotate their guard is granted by the `rotate`
function in the [coin contract](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node/blob/68c52f6fbf63e7539703b29ede4e626789846fb8/pact/coin-contract/v5/coin-v5.pact#L314-L324).
This is a natural operation to want for a normal username/secret governance
model. But it is not safe for use on Principal accounts, because Principal
account names are meant to be derivable from the guard that governs them. The
guard is the source of truth abouth the Principal account string. Rotating
to a new guard therefore breaks a Pact invariant. A Principal account with a
rotated guard would not be recognized by Pact as a Principal account, which
would cause it to fail a number of common safety checks in coin contract.
 
 This KIP proposes to add an assertion to the `rotate` function during the next
 upgrade of the coin contract, to protect principal account users from the
 negative effects of rotating their account guard.

# Implementation

To diable guard rotations on principal accounts, we will add an assertion to
the rotate function:

```pact
(defun rotate:string (account:string new-guard:guard)
  (with-capability (ROTATE account)
  
    ; **************************************
    ; *** Add this new enforce statement ***
    ; **************************************
    (enforce (not (is-principal account))
      "It is unsafe for principal accounts to rotate their guard")

    (with-read coin-table account
      { "guard" := old-guard }

      (enforce-guard old-guard)

      (update coin-table account
        { "guard" : new-guard }
        )))
  )
```

This change will roll out with the next deployment of coin contract, which is
scheduled for December 2023.

# Impact on Users

Non-principal accounts (e.g. vanity accounts) are unaffeced by this change.
Principal accounts that have already rotated their guards are unaffected by this
change.

Principal accounts for whom guard rotatation is an important part of their
expected workflow need to identify a new workflow. Since most accounts are
principal accounts, this means all accounts should expect not to be able to
rotate guards under an account. Please see [Workarounds](#workarounds) for
alternative solutions.

# Workarounds

Principal account holders (most accounts, including all "k:" accounts, are
principal, accounts), may want some way to rotate their guard, analogous to the
common security measure of regularly changing your password or rotating
certficates or other security credentials. But the invariants that relate
Principal account names to their guards explicitly preclude this. How else can
credentials be rotated?

The simplest solution is to rotate your principal account, not your guard; namely,
create a new account and transfer funds to it.
